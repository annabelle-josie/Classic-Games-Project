# Classic Games Emulator
This Classic Games Emulator was made to practice Python programming and improve my understanding of Git over the summer break from University. Looking to continue to expand it in the future!

## How to run

As this project is dependent on pygame, it should be installed before running

```bash

pip install pygame

```

Main.py should then be run

## Aims of Project

Use pygame to create graphics, and work to recreate classic games.
Work on game design principles, improve use of Git and Github - especially using meaningful commit messages
